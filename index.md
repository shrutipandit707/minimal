## Telecom Churn Case Study by Decision Tree Technique
> In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

## Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes
>For understanding Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, we will start with a small example and understand the end to end process. 
To start with, let's take a few sentences and classify them in two different classes - education or cinema. Each sentence will represent one document. In real-world cases, a document be any piece of text such as an email, a news article, a book review, a tweet etc. The analysis and the algorithm involved doesnâ€™t depend on the type of document we use.

## EMail Spam Detection and Classification using Linear SVM
> Today emails have become to be a standout amongst the most well-known and efficient types of correspondence for Internet clients. Hence because of its fame, the email will be misused. One such misuse is the posting of unwelcome,undesirable messages known as spam or junk messages. Email spam has different consequences. It diminishes productivity,consumes additional space in mailboxes, additional time, expands programming damaging viruses, and materials that containconceivably destructive data for Internet clients, destroys the stability of mail servers, and subsequently, clients invest lots of time for sorting approaching mail and erasing undesirable correspondence. So there is a need for spam detection so that its outcomes can be reduced. In this notebook, I propose a novel method for email spam detection using SVM and feature extraction.

## Multiple Linear Regression on Real Estate Data


> Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.
Essentially, the company wants â€”
- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
 To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

__So interpretation is important!__

The steps we will follow in this exercise are as follows:

- Reading,understanding and visualising the data
- Preparing the data for modelling(train-test split,rescaling etc.)
- Training the model
- Residual analysis
- Prediction and evaluation on test set

## Logistic Regression on Customer Churn Data


> Our data, sourced from Kaggle, is centered around customer churn, the rate at which a commercial customer will leave the commercial platform that they are currently a (paying) customer, of a telecommunications company. We did the EDA process has, and we have a pretty good sense of what our data tells us before processing, we built a Logistic Regression classification model which will allow for us to predict whether a customer is at risk to churn from Telcoâ€™s platform.
