This website contains projects that I have completed in AIML and Data science with Github links for each.



## Employee Attrition Classification System by GBM Classification
> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Gradient Boosting Classification Algortihm. We will be understanding and solving a risk analytics problem in Human Resources Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like The problem statement that we will be working on is to predict which factors led to employee attrition in a particular company.

## EMail Spam Detection and Classification using SVM
> Today emails have become to be a standout amongst the most well-known and efficient types of correspondence for Internet clients. Hence because of its fame, the email will be misused. One such misuse is the posting of unwelcome,undesirable messages known as spam or junk messages. Email spam has different consequences. It diminishes productivity,consumes additional space in mailboxes, additional time, expands programming damaging viruses, and materials that containconceivably destructive data for Internet clients, destroys the stability of mail servers, and subsequently, clients invest lots of time for sorting approaching mail and erasing undesirable correspondence. So there is a need for spam detection so that its outcomes can be reduced. In this notebook, I propose a novel method for email spam detection using SVM and feature extraction.

## Digit Recognition using SVM
> A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. Suppose that you have images of handwritten digits ranging from 0-9 written by various people in boxes of a specific size - similar to the application forms in banks and universities.

## Delhi Delight Case Study using Decision Tree Algorithm
> We work at Delhi Delights! which is a food delivery company in Delhi. It offers a premium membership called ‘Delighted Members’, with which there is no delivery cost for your order. Lately, the number of purchases of this premium membership has been going down. Now, based on past data, Delhi Delights! wants to predict which of the customers will buy the 'Delighted Members' membership and which ones will not.

## Multiple Linear Regression on Real Estate Data


> Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.
Essentially, the company wants —
- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
 To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

__So interpretation is important!__

The steps we will follow in this exercise are as follows:

- Reading,understanding and visualising the data
- Preparing the data for modelling(train-test split,rescaling etc.)
- Training the model
- Residual analysis
- Prediction and evaluation on test set

## Logistic Regression on Customer Churn Data


> Our data, sourced from Kaggle, is centered around customer churn, the rate at which a commercial customer will leave the commercial platform that they are currently a (paying) customer, of a telecommunications company. We did the EDA process has, and we have a pretty good sense of what our data tells us before processing, we built a Logistic Regression classification model which will allow for us to predict whether a customer is at risk to churn from Telco’s platform.
