## Lending Club Case Study for Loan Defaulter Prediction System

> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Exploratory Data Science techniques. We will be understanding and solving a risk analytics problem in Banking and Financial Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like defaulters prediction in Loan Lending club.

## Simple Linear Regression on Sales Data


> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Simple Linear Regression Techniques. We will be understanding and solving a risk analytics problem in Sales Domain.We will be checking how data modelling can be used effectively to solve business problems using Residual Analysis and Predicting and evaluating the test set

## Multiple Linear Regression on Bike Sharing Data


> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using Multiple Linear Regression Techniques. We will have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## Multiple Linear Regression on Real Estate Data


> Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region. It wishes to use the data to optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.
Essentially, the company wants —
- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
 To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

__So interpretation is important!__

The steps we will follow in this exercise are as follows:

- Reading,understanding and visualising the data
- Preparing the data for modelling(train-test split,rescaling etc.)
- Training the model
- Residual analysis
- Prediction and evaluation on test set

## Logistic Regression on Customer Churn Data


> Our data, sourced from Kaggle, is centered around customer churn, the rate at which a commercial customer will leave the commercial platform that they are currently a (paying) customer, of a telecommunications company. We did the EDA process has, and we have a pretty good sense of what our data tells us before processing, we built a Logistic Regression classification model which will allow for us to predict whether a customer is at risk to churn from Telco’s platform.
